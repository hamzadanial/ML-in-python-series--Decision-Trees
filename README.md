# ML-in-python-series--Decision-Trees
This repository contains a single, fully-annotated Jupyter notebook that walks step-by-step through the **Decision Tree**. It covers both **classification** and **regression** trees, visualisation, decision-boundary plots, regularisation (pre-pruning), cost-complexity pruning (post-pruning), and practical tips for using trees in real projects.
